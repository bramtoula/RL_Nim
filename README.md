# RL_Nim
trying out reinforcement learning for playing the "Nim" game for the mini-project of the Advanced Machine Learning course

Need to implement:
  - TD-learning (SARSA & Q-learning) /Nicolas
  - Policy gradient /Benjamin
  - Deepl learning /Roger

## Temporal-Difference Learning
I have started working on it
